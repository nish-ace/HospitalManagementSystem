# Hospital Management System

DBMS Project under guidance

### Problem Recognition:
    Healthcare is the most critical aspect of our society, and many health care providers face challenges to offer practical and active services to patients. Considering a multispeciality health care centre, many people enter and exit the centre in a day and maintaining their records safely is tedious. To reduce this type of burdens and to manage the financial, administration and clinical aspects, Health Care Management System came into existence.
    With the implementation of HMS in our healthcare centres, we will be able to treat patients in a better way, access their real-time reports and other information, their past clinical data and more can be done quickly and lead to best patient outcomes. Healthcare management system make employees work more accessible and improve the speed of the complete processes for better results.

### Evaluation and Synthesis:
    The project maintain two levels of users: 
      Administrator - the admin
      Operator - doctors, patients and the staff (both medical and non-medical)
    The portal includes:
      1. Setting up a patient's medical appointment.
      2. Maintaining doctor, patient, and staff details.
      3. Maintaining the medical record for each patient.
      4. Maintaining patient’s diagnosis details, prescription and medicine(s).
      5. Keeping patient’s records up to date and storing their records in the system for historical purposes.
      6. Admin can search a patient’s record by his/her id.
      7. Admin can view the availability of the doctors for any particular patient.
